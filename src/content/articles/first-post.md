## Time is Your Greatest Asset

We all have the same 24 hours in each day. 

Yet we all spend it differently. Everyone has their priorities and makes their own choices. Many of us fall into the way of thinking that 'squanders' time... I often think 'oh, I'll get around to that task later' or 'I have the rest of my life to do xyz...'. 

I believe this is the very trap Ben Franklin is warning us about. Time is what life is made of. We need to maximize it rather than squander it.
